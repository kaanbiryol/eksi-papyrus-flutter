A Flutter application for reading eksi-sozluk from mobile devices. 

## Background

I did not like any of the available [eksi-sozluk](https://eksisozluk.com) mobile apps so here it is, a clean reading experience for all the eksi readers out there. 

## For developers

This project was my first attempt at learning Flutter. This repo doesn't contain the architecture or coding styles that I would recommend. I was curious about Flutter and thought I would give it a try.

[Here](https://github.com/kaanbiryol/eksi-papyrus) is the Python API I used for this project.

## Future of this repo

I have no plans to develop this further or improve the architecture of the overall app. My goal was to create a usable Flutter app while experiencing the PRO's and CON's of the framework itself. If you wish to improve, fork or send pull requests.
